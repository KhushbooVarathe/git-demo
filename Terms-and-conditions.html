                  <h4 class="text-white">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>
                  <p>Please read this terms of service agreement (the “terms of service”) carefully.  This website and its subdomains (collectively, the “website”), the information on the website, and the services and resources available or enabled via the website (each a “service” and collectively with the website, the “services”), are controlled by lifestyle trading llc. (“company”).  These terms of service along with all supplemental terms that may be presented to you for your review and acceptance (collectively, the “agreement”), govern your access to and use of the services.  By clicking on the “accept terms of service” button, completing the registration process, browsing the website, or accessing or using any of the services, you represent that (1) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the agreement, (2) you are of legal age to form a binding contract with company, and (3) you have the authority to enter into the agreement personally or on behalf of the legal entity identified during the account registration process, and to bind that legal entity to the agreement.  The term “you” refers to the individual or such legal entity, as applicable.  If you, or if applicable, such legal entity, do not agree to be bound by the agreement, you, and if applicable, such legal entity, may not access or use any of the services.</p>
                  <p>If you subscribe to the services for a term (the “initial term”), the agreement will be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the initial term at company’s then-current fee for such services unless you terminate your subscription and/or your account in accordance with section 7.6 (automatic renewal) below.</p>
                  <p>Please be aware that section 14 (dispute resolution) of the agreement below contains provisions governing how any disputes between us will be resolved. In particular, it contains an arbitration agreement which will, with limited exceptions, require disputes between us to be submitted to binding and final arbitration.  Unless you opt out of the arbitration agreement: (1) you will only be permitted to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding; and (2) you are waiving your right to pursue claims and seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial.</p>
                  <p>Please be aware that section 1.4 (company communications) of the agreement below contains your opt-in consent to receive communications from us, including, as applicable, via e-mail, text message, calls and push notification.</p>
                  <p>Please note that the agreement is subject to change by company in its sole discretion at any time.  When changes are made, company will make a copy of the updated agreement available at the website and update the “last updated date” at the top of these terms of service.  If we make any material changes to the agreement, we will provide notice of such material changes on the website and attempt to notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address provided in your account registration.  Any changes to the agreement will be effective immediately for new users of the services and will be effective for existing registered users upon the earlier of (a) thirty (30) days after the “last updated date” at the top of these terms of service, or (b) your consent to and acceptance of the updated agreement if company provides a mechanism for your immediate acceptance in a specified manner (such as a click-through acceptance), which company may require before further use of the services is permitted.  If you do not agree to the updated agreement, you must stop using all services upon the effective date of the updated agreement.  Otherwise, your continued use of any of the services after the effective date of the updated agreement constitutes your acceptance of the updated agreement.  Please regularly check the website to view the then-current agreement. You agree that company’s continued provision of the services is adequate consideration for the changes in the updated agreement.</p>

Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card or PayPal account, and you must refer to that agreement, not this Agreement, to determine your rights and liabilities.  By providing Company with your credit card number or PayPal account and associated payment information, you agree that Company is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges as they become due and payable and that no additional notice or consent is required.  You agree to immediately notify Company of any change in your billing address or the credit card or PayPal account used for payment hereunder.

If Company determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you in connection with the Agreement, Company may collect such Sales Tax in addition to the payments required under Section 7.3 (Service Subscription Fees) of the Agreement.  If any services, or payments for any services, under the Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Company, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Company for any liability or expense Company may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes.  Upon Company’s request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes.  For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.</p>

AFTER YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, AND AGAIN AFTER ANY SUBSEQUENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY COMMENCE ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE END OF SUCH PERIOD (EACH A “RENEWAL COMMENCEMENT DATE”) AND CONTINUE FOR AN ADDITIONAL EQUIVALENT PERIOD, AT COMPANY’S THEN-CURRENT PRICE FOR SUCH SUBSCRIPTION.  YOU AGREE THAT YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE SUBJECT TO THIS AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FEATURE UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE RENEWAL COMMENCEMENT DATE, BY LOGGING INTO AND GOING TO THE “SUBSCRIPTION” PAGE OF YOUR “PROFILE” PAGE.  If you want to change or terminate your subscription, please log in and go to the “Cancel Subscription” section on your “PROFILE” page.  If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.  However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.  By subscribing, you authorize Company to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period.  Upon renewal of your subscription, if Company does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand and/or (b) you agree that Company may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).</p>
